  question: Right, seriously though why do you keep coming here?  The only reason
    this temple exists is, because people are scared of him and didn't want to offend
    him by not building a temple to him.  People don't come here, instead they go
    to Ambrosia and Alkyone with their problems and prayers They probably don't even
    realise that Plouton isn't evil. Why do you think is he so little prayed to?

    answer: He ignores prayers.
    feedback: 'Yes, it''s true. Plouton ignores all praise and prayers.  Rule one
      in becoming a priest in his temple is to realize that.  My guess is, that since
      people know, praying to him is pointless, they don''t do it.  But just because
      something is pointless doesn''t mean you shouldn''t do it!  The same thing
      is said about crying, but that doesn''t stop anyone from actually doing it
      every now and then. '

    answer: He is cruel.
    feedback: "How very novel for a greek god to be cruel!  I am sure that gods like
      Zeus and Poseidon \u2013 the most worshipped greek gods there are \u2013 have
      never been cruel in the past.  Oh wait! Remember that time they wiped out humanity
      in a fit of anger?  But nooo! Plouton is really cruel.  He is also responsible
      for wealth and the afterlife."

    answer: He is unimportant.
    feedback: "\u2026  For your sake, I will pretend I didn't hear that, and instead
      assume that you are an uneducated peasant that somehow ended up here. You realise
      that he is responsible for wealth and after-life?  No, the reason people don't
      pray to him is that Plouton ignores all praise and prayers.  My guess is, that
      since people know, praying to him is pointless they don't do it. "
