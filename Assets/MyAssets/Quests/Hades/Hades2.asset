    answer: Hades
    feedback: 'Don''t say that name! It brings bad luck!  Let me educate you:  Hades
      is the Underworld, as in its the name of the place.  Back in the day it was
      also the name of the god. Not any more though, nowadays we call him Plouton. 
      Plouton is the god of the underworld, after-life and fortune. So: Hades is
      NOT Plouton, got that?'

    answer: God of the Underworld
    feedback: "I see.  You were lucky and guessed the correct answer.  \u2026  So
      you realise that Hades and Plouton are not the same thing.  One is the Underworld
      and the other is the god.  You got that? "

    answer: Death
    feedback: 'Wrong. Let me educate you:  Death is Thanatos.  Hades is the Underworld,
      as in its the name of the place.  Back in the day it was also the name of the
      god.  Not any more though, nowadays we call him Plouton.  Plouton is the god
      of the underworld, after-life and fortune.'
