  question: "Apprentice, you are late!  \u2026  Yes... I realize you aren't, still
    let me enjoy this power-trip while it lasts.  So, today we will talk about how
    to correctly pray to Plouton.  It's not quite as easy as you may think it is.
    How does one pray to Plouton?"
  answers:

    answer: You raise your hands to the sky.
    feedback: Wrong, raising your hands to the sky, doesn't work at all for Plouton. 
      That's how you pray to the gods on Olympus.  You need to keep in mind that
      Plouton resides down below the earth, in the underworld.  That means you need
      to kneel down and pound on the ground to get his attention.  You can use the
      same method to pray to any of the other gods that reside in the underworld.

    answer: You put your hands together.
    feedback: "\u2026How would that do anything?  How do you wish to get any gods
      attention by doing something so minor?  Plouton resides down below the earth,
      in the underworld.  That means you need to kneel down and pound on the ground
      to get his attention.  You can use the same method to pray to any of the other
      gods that reside in the underworld."

    answer: You kneel and pound the ground.
    feedback: "Hmm\u2026 Not bad, you seem to be catching on quickly.  Plouton resides
      down below the earth, in the underworld.  That means you need to kneel down
      and pound on the ground to get his attention.  You can use the same method
      to pray to any of the other gods that reside in the underworld."
