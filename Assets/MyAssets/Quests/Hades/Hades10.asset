  question: "\u2026  \u2026  Why do people think that Plouton is evil?  He isn't
    and I am not evil either just because I am a priestess in a temple devoted to
    him.  \u2026  It is obvious that he can't be evil, he is in no position to be
    evil.  This is the last question, if you answer it correctly, you may as well
    be a priest of Plouton. Tell me, why can't Plouton be evil?"

    answer: He has a dog
    feedback: 'For example, when Hercules ventured into the underworld to capture
      his dog Cerberus, Plouton just gave his dog to him, but only under one condition: 
      Hercules had to ensure him that the dog wouldn''t be harmed.  Besides as the
      god responsible for the afterlife he has to keep a certain balance. Balance
      must be kept. The Dead need to remain there.  And just because he is doing
      his job, he is considered evil? Pah! '

    answer: He has to keep balance
    feedback: 'Correct.  As the god of afterlife, he has no business being good or
      evil.  He is a necessary part of the world and how it works, he is if anything
      neutral.  But his position gives a certain responsibility and authority that
      he has to convey.  Balance must be kept. The Dead need to remain there.  And
      just because he is doing his job, he is considered evil? Pah! '

    answer: He is a stern, but fair ruler
    feedback: 'Exactly.  He has a certain responsibility to full fill and he does
      that very well.  He is fair in his judgement, and treats everyone the same. 
      Balance must be kept. The Dead need to remain there.  And that is why he is
      feared, not because he does evil acts, but because we keep breaking his rules
      and then call him evil or cruel because he re-enforces them. '
