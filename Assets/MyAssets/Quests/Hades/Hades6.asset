  question: You have things to learn.  See, I decided that because of your persistent
    commitment to talk with me, I will educate you in all matter surrounding Plouton. 
    That way, you have something to fall back on and you can become a priest, when
    your current job eventually falls through. No need to thank me.  Which animal
    is best suites as sacrifice to Plouton?

    answer: Oxen
    feedback: Not bad, you seem to know a few things already.  Oxen are very good
      since they are easy to get and have black fur.  Plouton prefers animals with
      black fur.  After all black is the absence of color.  Fitting for a god that
      reigns over the after-life.  Which is the absence of life.

      You would probably offend the gods with that kind of offering!  Oxen are better
      suited since they are easy to get and have black fur.  Plouton prefers animals
