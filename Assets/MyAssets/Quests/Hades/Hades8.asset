  question: If it isn't my very own apprentice.  Do you know what time it is?  It's
    time to learn about Plouton, so you can make something of yourself one day! 
    This one shouldn't be hard to answer.  After all you must have done enough sacrifices
    to know this.  Besides the same logic applies to all previous questions. How
    do we make sure Plouton receives our sacrifices?

    answer: We burn them
    feedback: "Ugh\u2026 No\u2026  I guess I overestimated your intelligence.  No,
      burning it would make the smoke carry the sacrifice to the sky.  That's not
      what we want, we need it to be carried into the underworld.  To achieve this
      we let the sacrifice bleed into a deep hole.  That way it is certain to reach
      the underworld."

    answer: We throw it into the water
    feedback: Do you think this is some sort of joke?  The water is very clearly
      not the domain of Plouton, no if you do that it will be carried to Poseidon. 
      That's not what we want, we need it to be carried into the underworld.  To
      achieve this we let the sacrifice bleed into a deep hole.  That way it is certain
      to reach the underworld.

    answer: We let it bleed into a hole
    feedback: Oh, I am gonna make a priest of you yet.  Correct. As you know Plouton
      resides in the Underworld, so we need to make sure it gets there.  To achieve
      this we let the sacrifice bleed into a deep hole.  That way it is certain to
      reach the underworld.
