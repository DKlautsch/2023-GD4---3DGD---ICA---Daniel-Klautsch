  question: "\u2026  Hmm?  \u2026  What about it?  \u2026  I am pretty sure you can
    answer your own question. Why is there a living snake in the temple?"

    answer: It's a sacrifice
    feedback: Literally one of his signs is the snake!  To sacrifice one in his name
      would be one good way to invoke death upon yourself, yes.  No, the snake keeps
      the temple free of mice and rats.  Besides it's a nice pet to have on boring
      days.  Speaking of sacrifices, are you planning on sacrificing anything to
      Plouton today?

    answer: It's to scare Ambrosia away.
    feedback: "Heh\u2026 You aren't wrong...hehe  Hehehe\u2026 What?!  Don't give
      me that look! It's not my fault she doesn't like snakes!  Besides I just don't
      want any of that Zeus-enthusiasm in here,  As if a single god could cure everything\u2026 
      But no, the snake keeps the temple free of mice and rats.  Besides it's a nice
      pet to have on boring days."

    answer: It keeps the temple clean.
    feedback: "Yes, it does. It always sweeps the floor in the morning and does the
      laundry in the evening.  \u2026  In Case you didn't catch it, I am jesting. 
      Yes, it keeps the temple clean...  Specifically speaking, it keeps the temple
      clean of any mice and rats, that may decide to come here."
