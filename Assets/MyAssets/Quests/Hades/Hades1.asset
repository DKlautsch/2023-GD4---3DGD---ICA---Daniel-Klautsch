    feedback: 'You probably just stumbled in here by accident, didn''t you ? This
      temple is devoted to Hades, or how you will refer to him Plouton. It is factionally
      the best temple, and houses the best Priestess : Me. My name is Athanasia but
      you can refer to me simply as the priestess. If you don''t want to sacrifice
      anything, don''t bother me.'

    answer: I wanted to sacrifice things to Hades.
    feedback: 'Don''t call him that ! It brings bad luck to say his name out loud.
      Besides it''s not even his actual name. This temple is devoted to Hades, or
      how you will refer to him Plouton. It is factionally the best temple, and houses
      the best Priestess : Me. My name is Athanasia but you can refer to me simply
      as priestess. If you don''t want to sacrifice anything, don''t bother me.'
