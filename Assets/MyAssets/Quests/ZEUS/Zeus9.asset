  question: "Greetings! You know, sometimes I feel like I should ask people more
    questions. No, not like that, I meant questions, that I don't know the answer
    to. Personal questions. It's not much, but showing that little bit of interest
    is always appreciated by people, so\u2026 How are you doing today?"

    answer: Pretty good
    feedback: That's good to hear! I am always happy when the people around me are
      happy as well. Unless you are trying to tell me something with the use of the
      word pretty. I mean, pretty good, is a bit relative isn't it? Oh, sorry I am
      starting to rant again, aren't I? I swear to Zeus, one of these days I will
      straight up be an old hag, that tells the same tales over and over again.

    answer: Miserable
    feedback: "I am so sorry to hear that\u2026 I sincerely hope you will be able
      to feel better soon. I know I don't really know why you are so miserable, but\u2026
      Whatever it is, I am sure you can pull through it! You hear that, I believe
      in you! And that means you should believe in yourself too! Because it is very
      important that if nobody else, at least you believe in yourself and carry on."

    answer: Meh
    feedback: "Ah\u2026 Yes, I know these days. The ones were you just feel a bit
      lifeless and bored. Not bad, not good, just meh. But it's not necessarily bad,
      you know. See it as an opportunity to relax a little. I know you have a lot
      to manage all the time, but sometimes you should just take a break sit back
      and have a relaxing time, maybe enjoy a nap. Oh, sorry I am starting to rant
      again, aren't I?"
