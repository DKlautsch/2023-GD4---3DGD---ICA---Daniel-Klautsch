  question: 'Greetings! I was going to talk about the involvement of a certain god
    in marriages. Yes, as you can probably guess: Zeus. He isn''t exactly the main-god
    of marriage, but he was married to the main-goddess of marriage. So, how about
    this instead. Why do you think Zeus is mentioned in marriages?'

    answer: Due to his marriage with Hera.
    feedback: Quite possibly, that is part of the reason. But it's mostly because
      of the countless relations he had with all sorts of women. He was in relations
      with countless of gods, and he was even in relations with over a dozen women.
      And not just women, even men. At least that's what I hear, probably just a
      rumour... I mean we Greeks live in modern times, a person's sexual orientation
      certainly doesn't identify them in any social way.

    answer: Due to his power over the weather.
    feedback: "Oh, I get it. Because nobody wants bad weather during their wedding.
      I never thought about that. It's a good point. But it's mostly because of the
      countless relations he had with all sorts of women. And not just women, even
      men. At least that's what I hear, probably just a rumour... I mean we Greeks
      live in modern times, a person's sexual orientation certainly doesn't identify
      them in any social way. To each their own, really\u2026"

    answer: Due to his marriages
    feedback: 'Exactly, that is it! He really had countless of lovers: Mnemosyne,
      Leto, Dione, Maia, Semele, Alcmene, Io, Themis, Eurynome, Europa, Metis. And
      those are only a few of the ones I know about. He also had quite a lot of relations
      with mortal women. It makes you wonder...'
