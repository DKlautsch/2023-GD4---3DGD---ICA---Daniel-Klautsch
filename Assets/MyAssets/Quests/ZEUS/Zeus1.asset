  question: Greetings, I welcome you to the temple of Zeus. My name is Ambrosia.
    I am the priestess of this temple and as such it is my responsibility, to make
    sure you are sufficently knowledgable about the king of all gods, Zeus. So, how
    familiar are you with Zeus?

    answer: He is the god of the underworld.
    feedback: N-No, you are thinking of Hades right now, which is almost the opposite
      of Zeus. No, Zeus is the god of thunder, but he has many many other titles
      as well. But, its alright that you didn't know... that just means I will have
      to try even harder to make you learn about Zeus. I am sure that eventually
      you are going to know all about him, and I am going to be so proud of you,
      when you do.

    answer: He is that strong demi-god guy.
    feedback: I suspect you are thinking of Hercules right now. Hercules just so
      happens to be the son of Zeus, so now you know where all that godly power came
      from. I think you will soon find that Zeus is the god of thunder, but he has,
      of course, many other titles relating to his other duties. But, its alright
      that you didn't know... that just means I will have to try even harder to make
      you learn about Zeus.

    answer: He is the god of thunder
    feedback: Yes! Well, I mean no-- I mean yes. He is the god of thunder yes, but
      there is so much more he does than just that.  I am sure you can imagine that
      as king of all gods, Zeus has his hands quite full all the time with all sorts
      of things. But it's good to see that you are somewhat familiar with what he
      does.
