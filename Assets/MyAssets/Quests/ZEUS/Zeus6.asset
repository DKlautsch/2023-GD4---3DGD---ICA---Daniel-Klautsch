  question: You know, have you ever thought about your own name, and what it's implications
    are based on where you go and what you do? You remember my name, right? It's
    all right if not, I always have trouble remembering new names as well. My Name
    is Ambrosia, which is funny when considering that I am a priestess in a temple
    of Zeus. You realize why it's funny, right?

    answer: The name relates to immortality
    feedback: True, it does. And that is ironic in its own way. But what I meant
      was how it relates to Ambrosia, the food of the gods. Makes me wonder if my
      name is the reason I am a priestess or the fact that I would later become a
      priestess is why I have the name. Or maybe I am looking to deep into it, who
      knows. But it's fun to think about What about your name?

    answer: The name relates to food
    feedback: "Yes, the food of the gods to be specific. It's fascinating to me that
      even my name is a connection to the gods. Makes me wonder if my name is the
      reason I am a priestess or the fact that I would later become a priestess is
      why I have the name. Or maybe I am looking to deep into it, who knows. But
      it's fun to think about\u2026 What about your name?"

    answer: The name relates to fire
    feedback: "Huh? Oh, because it's like the word Amber? Amber-osia? Heh, that sounds
      funny, but no that wasn't what I meant. Rather Ambrosia is also known as the
      food of the gods. Makes me wonder if my name is the reason I am a priestess
      or the fact that I would later become a priestess is why I have the name. Or
      maybe I am looking to deep into it, who knows. But it's fun to think about\u2026"
