  question: It's a lovely day for a sacrifice, isn't it? Listen, I have been thinking.
    You come here and bring sacrifices, but don't you wanna know the procedure in
    which they are sacrificed? Of Course you do! Now, what do you think? What kind
    of animal is best suited as sacrifice for Zeus?

    answer: Horse
    feedback: "A Horse? Well, It's not the worst choice, but not exactly the most
      suited one for Zeus. Horses are more a Poseidon thing. Goats are the best option.
      Even more specifically white furred goats. White is the purest of colors, and
      so it is only fitting that it goes to Zeus. \u2026 Well, technically white
      isn't a color, but\u2026 uhh\u2026 you understood what I meant, right?"

    answer: Wolf
    feedback: "A Wolf? Hmm, that seems more like a Hades thing to me. Besides, it
      seems a bit inconvenient to get wolves. Goats are the best option. Even more
      specifically white furred goats. White is the purest of colors, and so it is
      only fitting that it goes to Zeus. \u2026 Well, technically white isn't a color,
      but\u2026 uhh\u2026 you understood what I meant, right?"
