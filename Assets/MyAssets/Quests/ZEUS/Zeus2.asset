  question: Hey, I see you have some sacrificial meat with you already! It's good
    to see that you are coming prepared, but you know there is one tiny problem when
    sacrificing so much meat. Flies, it lures an awful lot of pesky flies. But of
    course, yours truly knows exactly what to do to get rid of them. Can you guess
    what it is?

    answer: Anti-Bug Spray
    feedback: "Anti\u2026 what? I am sorry, I am not sure I know what you mean. But
      how would that work? Zeus also happens to be known as the Disperser of flies
      under the name: Apomyius. So by making a sacrifice in Apomyiuses name, we got
      rid of the flies."

    answer: More Meat
    feedback: 'Yes, I know it sounds silly, but that is right. We make a sacrifice
      to Zeus. Zeus also happens to be known as the Disperser of flies under the
      name: Apomyius. So by making a sacrifice in Apomyiuses name, we got rid of
      the flies.'

    answer: Spiders
    feedback: 'Eww, no. Maybe that''s a thing they do in the temple of Hades, but
      here in the temple of Zeus I try to keep everything clean and keep spiders
      and the like out. No, the solution is much cleaner. Zeus also happens to be
      known as the Disperser of flies under the name: Apomyius. So by making a sacrifice
      in Apomyiuses name, we got rid of the flies.'
