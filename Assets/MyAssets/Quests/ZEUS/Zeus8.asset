  question: "I am\u2026 a bit sick today, so let's keep it short\u2026 Uhm\u2026
    Let's see, you probably want to learn something interesting about Zeus. Did you
    know that Zeus is responsible for weather and harvest of crops? You did? Uhh\u2026
    I am sorry, I am just really not feeling well today. Do you know anything interesting
    about Zeus?"

    answer: He lives on Mount Olympus.
    feedback: Indeed he does. Zeus lives there with a lot of other gods. Sniff Sorry,
      I am not really in the right mind today, but I will be fully up again next
      week.

    answer: He once wiped out humanity.
    feedback: "Ah, yeah. That's true. At some point he grew annoyed with humanity
      and all the war we created. So, he decided in a fit of rage that he should
      kill them all in a great flood. This was easily done with the help of his brother,
      Poseidon. But then he created us anew. I guess we should always remember that
      even in his wisdom, he is quite violent and often uses violence to get what
      he wants. \u2026 But he probably has his reasons."

    answer: Don't worry, get better soon.
    feedback: Thanks for understanding. I can still perform the sacrifice for you
      though. I just kind of need to rest my eyes a bit afterwards.
