  question: Hey, it's my favourite city-manager! You should stay away from me this
    week. I am feeling like I am coming up with some illness. But, I know just the
    way how to avoid it. Can you guess what my not so secret technique of avoiding
    illness is?

    answer: Greek Medicine
    feedback: You mean all that stuff that Hippocrates invented recently? Honestly,
      I am not sure I trust the whole Hippocratic oath thing... See, Zeus happens
      to be known as the Averter of ills, Apemius. Now, that doesn't mean Illness
      specifically but more generally any bad things, but I am sure its gonna apply
      to illness as well. A quick sacrifice to him and I will be in great shape again.

    answer: Taking it easy for a while
    feedback: Hmm, that sounds pretty reasonable, but I think it's better if I first
      try doing something against it and then rest up a bit. The medicine I mentioned
      is, of course, Zeus. See, Zeus happens to be known as the Averter of ills,
      Apemius. Now, that doesn't mean Illness specifically but more generally any
      bad things, but I am sure its gonna apply to illness as well. A quick sacrifice
      to him and I will be in great shape again.

    answer: Does the answer involve sacrificing something to Zeus?
    feedback: You bet it does ! I am so glad that you are starting to understand
      that most things can be solved by sacrificing things to Zeus. See, Zeus happens
      to be known as the Averter of ills, Apemius. Now, that doesn't mean Illness
      specifically but more generally any bad things, but I am sure its gonna apply
      to illness as well. A quick sacrifice to him and I will be in great shape again.
