  question: 'Hey! I was hoping, you would come her today. See, there is something
    I wanted to ask about, and it is a bit of a difficult topic to discuss. So, I
    think I will just ask you straight: What do you think about sacrificing humans
    to Zeus?'

    answer: I am sure he would appreciate human sacrifices.
    feedback: "But how are you so certain about that? Hades accepts human sacrifices,
      perhaps it's naive to think Zeus wouldn't? Then again on the other hand, there
      is that story about a father who sacrificed his son to Zeus. Zeus wasn't happy
      about that and turned him into a wolf. But\u2026 If it is any condolences,
      if you were turned into a Wolf I would pet you."

    answer: No! There is no way, he would want that!

    answer: Depends on the circumstances.
    feedback: "Hmm, but what kind of circumstances would justify the act then\u2026?
