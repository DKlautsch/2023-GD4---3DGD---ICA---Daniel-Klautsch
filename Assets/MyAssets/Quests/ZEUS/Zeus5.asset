  question: The rituals and ceremonies we perform certainly look and feel very mystical.
    I already told you about what Zeus likes to have sacrificed, but we haven't really
    talked about the how. There is a certain way, in which one needs to perform the
    ceremony. How do you think we ensure that the gods receive our sacrifice?

    answer: Burning the Sacrifice
    feedback: Yup, we burn it. The flames take the sacrifice and carry it to Zeus
      through the smoke. For most gods, you simply burn the sacrifice, since most
      of them live up high and thus are sure to receive the sacrifice, however a
      few specific gods, have different ways of receiving their perspective sacrifice,
      since they reside in different places.

    answer: Burying the Sacrifice
    feedback: Why would you think that? How is Zeus supposed to get it, if we bury
      it in the ground? The flames take the sacrifice and carry it to Zeus through
      the smoke. For most gods, you simply burn the sacrifice, since most of them
      live up high and thus are sure to receive the sacrifice, however a few specific
      gods, have different ways of receiving their perspective sacrifice, since they
      reside in different places.

    answer: Spilling it's blood on the Altar
    feedback: That is an important part of the ceremony, yes. But it isn't how we
      make sure it is received by Zeus. The flames take the sacrifice and carry it
      to Zeus through the smoke. For most gods, you simply burn the sacrifice, since
      most of them live up high and thus are sure to receive the sacrifice, however
