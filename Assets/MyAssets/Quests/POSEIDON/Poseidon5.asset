  question: "Hey! So, did\u2026 did you meet them yet ? The other temple priestesses.
    Ambrosia is really nice, right? And I know that Athenasia is a bit rough around
    the edges, but she is also a nice person deep down. Oh, you want to know about
    how to sacrifice to Poseidon. Well, how do you think you would sacrifice a horse
    to him?"

    feedback: "...Uhm\u2026 N-No\u2026 I\u2026 That's not quite it. What you need
      to do, is drown the animals in the ocean. That way, you honor Poseidon's creation
      of the horse."

    answer: Let it bleed into the ocean.
    feedback: That sounds reasonable, but is not quite how it goes. What you need
      to do, is drown the animals in the ocean. That way, you honor Poseidon's creation
      of the horse.

    answer: Drown it.
    feedback: Yes, you drown the horses in the ocean. That way, you honor Poseidon's
      creation of the horse.
