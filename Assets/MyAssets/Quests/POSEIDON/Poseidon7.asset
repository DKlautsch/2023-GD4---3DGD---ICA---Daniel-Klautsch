  question: "Hmm\u2026 Wah!  I- Where did you come from ?  Sorry, sorry, I was daydreaming
    a bit. I was wondering what if instead of a priestess\u2026 Well\u2026 I was
    just wondering if maybe I should play some sports in my off-time. I was thinking
    about a very popular sport. Can you guess what it is?"

    answer: Kicking a ball into a goal
    feedback: "You mean Episkyros? It's very brutal I have heard, and I have seen
      enough people get hurt by playing it. No, I was thinking about bull-leaping.
      You know the sport where a bull charges at you and you have to jump over it.
      I know it sounds very dangerous\u2026. but it looks kind of fun. Besides, everything
      is dangerous. Life is too short to be scared of jumping over a bull."

    answer: Moving figures over a board
    feedback: 'Ah, a fellow Petteia player I see. It''s a really fun game, isn''t
      it? Every player gets 2 rows full with their own figures, and then they have
      to move them in such way that they surround the enemy figurine so that you
      can capture it. But I already play that game...No, I was thinking about bull-leaping.
      You know the sport where a bull charges at you and you have to jump over it. '

    answer: Jumping over a charging bull
    feedback: "Yes! So you have heard of Bull-Leaping? Wouldn't it be interesting
      to try yourself? I know it sounds very dangerous\u2026. But when I see how
      gracious and elegantly some people do it\u2026 it looks kind of fun. Besides,
      everything is dangerous. Life is too short to be scared of jumping over a bull.
      Then again\u2026 it is dangerous. ...I think I will just have to be satisfied
      with daydreaming about it."
