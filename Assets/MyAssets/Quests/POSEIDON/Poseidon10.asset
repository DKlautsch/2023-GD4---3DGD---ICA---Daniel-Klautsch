  question: "Hey, careful! You almost fell down the stairs\u2026 Don't make me worry
    like that. Speaking about which you know the story of how Zeus, Poseidan and
    Hades became gods right? Their father Cronus ate them, but Zeus cut open his

      believing that Poseidon was a lamb, which he then ate.
