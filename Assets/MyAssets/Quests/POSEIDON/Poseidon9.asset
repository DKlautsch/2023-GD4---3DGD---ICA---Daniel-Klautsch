  question: "Remember when we talked about Archimedeses wacky burning mirrors invention?
    He created a new weapon of naval destruction. It's some sort of claw that turns
    the ship itself upside down so that it immediately fills with water and sinks.
    It's fascinating. I wonder if it actually exists, again it just seems\u2026 so
    fantastical. Do you think it's real?"

    answer: Seems farfetched
    feedback: "Mmm\u2026. I guess you are right\u2026 I mean, nothing is capable
      of rivaling Poseidon's power on the sea anyway. Then again\u2026 The claw of
      Archimedes does sound oddly do- able."

    answer: It seems possibly
    feedback: "I know. It just seems like in theory it may be possibly, you would
      just need enough force.  I wonder, what it would look like\u2026"

    answer: I believe it's real
    feedback: It's always good to keep an open mind. But I wonder what it would look
      like...
