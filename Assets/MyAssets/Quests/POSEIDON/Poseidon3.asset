    answer: Weapon
    feedback: "Possibly\u2026 It can certainly be used as a weapon. But other than
      that, it has the ability to control the ocean and can create earthquakes, he
      also uses it to create Tsunamis storms and waves."

    answer: Fishing
    feedback: "I\u2026 yes, the trident can presumably be used to fish. In fact that
      is what tridents are for, but I am uncertain if Poseidon's Trident is for that
      purpose. His trident has the ability to control the ocean and can create earthquakes,
      he also uses it to create Tsunamis storms and waves."
