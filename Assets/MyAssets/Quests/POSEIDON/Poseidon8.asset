  question: "Hey! Have you lately taken a look at the new sorts of inventions there
    are? It's fascinating isn't it ? We live in the future. There was no time in
    which there were as many innovations as there are now. There is one that I heard
    about that is used in naval battles against Ships. A guy named Archimedes made
    it. It's some sort of laser that set ships on fire. It's so weird, he must have
    stolen that idea from the very gods. Using light to set ships on fire\u2026 Any
    idea how it works?"

    answer: The mirrors focus the light.
    feedback: "But\u2026 is that enough to set a ship on fire, especially considering
      how far away it is from the laser?  It just all seems a bit surreal. But I
      think you are right, it was called the burning mirror.  The only way I can
      explain it to myself is that Archimedes must have had the help of the gods."

    answer: Ships are easily flammable.
    feedback: "Oh, because of the tar used to make it water-repellant? It's true,
      Tar is easily flammable. I suppose that would explain it\u2026 I guess then
      Archimedeses burning mirror actually works? But even then? It\u2026 hmm\u2026
      it still seems far fetched. \\n He must have had the assistance of gods in
      creating that invention."

    answer: Didn't really happen.
    feedback: "Oh\u2026 I guess you are probably right. It does seem a bit unrealistic,
      but\u2026 still... isn't the idea of it exciting? Besides, who know maybe in
      a few years, Archimedeses burning mirror will actually be possible\u2026 Yous
      should never lose your sense of wonder. \\n At least that's what I think...
      ...Ah, but realistically speaking you are probably right."
