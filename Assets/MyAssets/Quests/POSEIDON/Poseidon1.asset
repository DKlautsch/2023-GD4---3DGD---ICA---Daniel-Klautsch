  question: "Hi! This is the temple of Poseidon. So, you can sacrifice things for
    Poseidon here, if you want.  And\u2026 well it's not as important but my name
    is Alkyone.  So...uhm, if there\u2026 if you need help with anything just ask.

    answer: God of Rain
    feedback: "Water is an important part of Poseidon. But\u2026 I am afraid he isn't
      responsible for\u2026 Rain. That would be Zeus, he is responsible for all sort
      of weather. On the other hand, Poseidon is responsible for storms at seas,
      which I admit can also be seen as weather. I-I am very sorry if this is confusing.
      Poseidon is responsible for sea, storms and earthquakes and horses."

    answer: The Inventor of the Horse
    feedback: "Yes\u2026 Poseidon invented the horse. To be specific he is the father
      of the first horse that ever came to be. But that is far from the only thing
      he did. He is also responsible for the sea, storms and earthquakes. Poseidon
      is responsible for sea, storms and earthquakes and horses. You can only sacrifice
      to one god at a time...But I am not trying to get rid of you, you can also
      stay here."

    answer: King of Atlantis
    feedback: "No, that is a good assumption, but it isn't accurate. One of his children,
      Atlas is the King of Atlantis.  Poseidon is responsible for sea, storms and
      earthquakes and horses. So, I am sure you already know this but\u2026 you can
      only sacrifice to one god at a time. But I am not trying to get rid of you,
      you can also stay here."
