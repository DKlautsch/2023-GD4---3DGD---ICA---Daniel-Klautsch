  question: H-Hello. I see you are here to sacrifice to Poseidon. The sea is really
    beautiful today. You know sailors have a certain tradition that they follow before
    they set out on any big journeys across the sea. \n I am sure you can guess what
    that Tradition is. So, what do sailors do in preparation of traveling over the
    sea?

    answer: Sacrifice to Poseidon
    feedback: "Yes\u2026 It's tradition for sailors to make an offering to Poseidon
      so he may give them a safe passage during their travels. You\u2026 don't want
      to have Poseidon as an enemy, when traveling the sea\u2026 The past has shown
      it's not recommendable."

      important. It's tradition for sailors to make an offering to Poseidon so he
