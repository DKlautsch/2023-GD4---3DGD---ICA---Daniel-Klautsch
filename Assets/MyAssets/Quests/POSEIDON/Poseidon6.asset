  question: "Welcome back! I prepared everything, so that you can get right away
    to make an offering to Zeus. Say, Did you know that some god accept human sacrifices
    ? I am not certain, how I feel about that, it's a bit\u2026 odd. I once tried
    talking with Athanasia about it, but she just said something about how it's only
    logical to do it because of the inevitability of death. What do you think?"

      the matter."

    answer: Maybe it's more fitting to certain gods.
    feedback: "I-I am sure that it would fit perfectly in thematic to some gods,
      b-but that's not my problem. It\u2026 just seems wrong to me for many reasons.
      I could never sacrifice another living human being. I just hope that one day,
      others will share my opinion on the matter."

    answer: Humans aren't that different from animals.
    feedback: "Wh\u2013 What?! But! But a human life doesn't even come close to the
      same value of an animal's life.  It\u2026 just seems wrong to me for many reasons.
      I could never sacrifice another living human being. I just hope that one day,
      you will share my opinion on the matter."
